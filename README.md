# Citibike 2019 Ride Analysis 

## Overview 

The goal is to understand rider usage rates in New York City in order to translate success to Des Moines. The breakdown of the rider demographics and ride counts are shown in the tableau story link. 

## Results 

**Starting Station Locations** 
Even though New York is a large state, most rides appear to have started in the southern portion of Manhattan (Soho, Tribeca, West Village), which are higher residental areas. It would make sense to create several station locations in a concentrated area  with several apartments within Des Moines as well to promote commuter use. 

**Trip Time Overall and by Gender**
Station locations should be set up so that rides can be shorter than an hour in length. The ideal time frame for the ride length appears to be around 5 minutes according to the NYC data. Men are the higher users of the bikes for any trip duration amount. 

**Trip Hours and Days**
The highest usage times in NYC were around 8 am and 5 pm, which is typically the start and end of work during the weekdays. The weekends showed more consistent usage throughout the afternoons, indicating tourist usage and potentially more people biking for recreational reasons.
