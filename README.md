# Citibike 2019 Ride Analysis 

## Overview 

The goal is to understand rider usage rates in New York City in order to translate success to Des Moines. The breakdown of the rider demographics and ride counts are shown in the tableau story link. 

## Results 

**Starting Station Locations** 

Even though New York is a large state, most rides appear to have started in the southern portion of Manhattan (Soho, Tribeca, West Village), which are higher residental areas. It would make sense to create several station locations in a concentrated area  with several apartments within Des Moines as well to promote commuter use. 

**Trip Time Overall and by Gender**

Station locations should be set up so that rides can be shorter than an hour in length. The ideal time frame for the ride length appears to be around 5 minutes according to the NYC data. Men are the higher users of the bikes for any trip duration amount. 

**Trip Hours and Days**

The highest usage times in NYC were around 8 am and 5 pm, which is typically the start and end of work during the weekdays. Both men and women follow this pattern. The weekends showed more consistent usage throughout the afternoons, indicating tourist usage and potentially more people biking for recreational reasons. Usage is lowest in the early morning hours (3 am), so that is a good time to perform maintenance on the bikes. 

**Trip Count by User Type** 

It appears that most of the citibike use is through subscribers during the week. This is a good indicator of success for Des Moines because the repeat business is stable and less variable with tourist usage. The highest single customer usage appears to be on Saturdays, which is more likely recreational or tourist use. 

**Trip Usage by Customer Age**

Most trips were completed by customers in their late 20s and early 30s. As age increases past those time frames, usage rates decline. There was a spike of unknown gender usage at 50 years of age, which appears to be an outlier or data error and was removed from the dataset. 

## Summary

The highest usage rates in New York City are among male customers around 30 years old. Most of these users are subscribers that are commuting to and from work. This should translate well to Des Moines because the demographic is not unique to New York. An additional analysis that should be completed prior to investing is the usage rates in the winter months. Because both New York and Des Moines have cold winters, it is important to understand how much business will decrease. It would also be good to understand how maintenace costs will increase because of freezing and wet weather in order to decide whether the bikes should be stored in an indoor warehouse during those months.
